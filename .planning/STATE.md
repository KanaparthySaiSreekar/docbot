# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-02-04)

**Core value:** Fully automated appointment booking and management that eliminates manual coordination - patients can book, pay, cancel, and receive prescriptions entirely through WhatsApp while the doctor focuses solely on consultations through a clean web interface.
**Current focus:** Phase 1 - Foundation

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 5 (Foundation)
Plan: 3 of 4 in current phase
Status: In progress
Last activity: 2026-02-05 — Plans 01-02 and 01-03 completed

Progress: [███░░░░░░░] 75%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 3
- Average duration: 14 min
- Total execution time: 0.7 hours

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 01-foundation | 3/4 | 42 min | 14 min |

**Recent Trend:**
- Last 5 plans: 01-01 (12min), 01-02 (17min), 01-03 (13min)
- Trend: Consistent velocity (~12-17 min per plan)

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- **Foundation Phase**: SQLite chosen for single-doctor deployment simplicity
- **Foundation Phase**: UTC storage with IST display prevents timezone bugs
- **Foundation Phase**: Self-hosted deployment on Ubuntu homelab via Cloudflare tunnel
- **01-01**: Complete configuration schema defined upfront covering all 5 phases to prevent future schema changes
- **01-01**: Environment-based config files (config.test.json, config.prod.json) with .gitignore protection for secrets
- **01-01**: Request ID correlation via ContextVar for tracing related log entries
- **01-02**: TDD approach ensures state machine, timezone, and idempotency correctness before features depend on them
- **01-02**: Database-level slot locking via PRIMARY KEY constraint prevents race conditions
- **01-02**: Idempotency event_id is globally unique (not per-source) for complete deduplication
- **01-02**: tzdata dependency required for Windows timezone support (ZoneInfo)
- **01-03**: Session never expires (max_age=None) per AUTH-02 requirement
- **01-03**: Any Google account accepted (no allowlist) per AUTH-03 requirement
- **01-03**: Protected routes check session directly rather than using dependency injection for cleaner redirect handling

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- **User setup required for 01-03**: Google OAuth credentials must be configured before production deployment (google_client_id, google_client_secret, session_secret_key)
